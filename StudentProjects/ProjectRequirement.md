# Data Science Project Preparation – Requirements

## 1. **Project Idea**

* Think of a **real-world problem or question** you are curious about.
* Your project must have a **clear objective** (e.g., "predict house prices," "analyze student study habits," "classify types of music," "detect fake news").
* The idea should be **specific and feasible**—not too broad, but still meaningful.

👉 **Deliverable**: Write a short description (3–5 sentences) explaining:

* The problem/question you want to solve.
* Why this topic is interesting or important.
* What type of data you think you will need.

## 2. **Data Collection**

You are responsible for **finding or building your dataset**.
Here are the methods you can use:

1. **Search online** for open datasets (Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, government open data portals, etc.).
2. **Download structured data** (CSV, JSON, Excel) that is publicly available.
3. **Collect your own data** (e.g., surveys, web scraping, personal observations).

⚠️ **Rules**:

* Dataset must have at least **200 rows (records)** and at least **5 features (columns)**.
* Data must be **relevant** to your project idea.
* Do not use datasets that are too “overused” (like the Titanic dataset) unless you add your own twist.
* If you create your own dataset, document how you collected it.

👉 **Deliverable**: Provide the raw dataset file (CSV/Excel/JSON) and the link/source where you found it (if applicable).

## 3. **Data Documentation**

For every dataset, you must explain:

1. **Source** – where you got the data.
2. **Size** – number of rows and columns.
3. **Features** – list of the columns with a short description of each.
4. **Potential Issues** – any missing values, errors, or biases you expect.

👉 **Deliverable**: A short report (1–2 pages, or a Google Doc) describing your dataset.

---

## 4. **Submission Requirements**

* One project idea description (short paragraph).
* One dataset file (CSV, Excel, or JSON).
* One short dataset documentation report.

---

## 5. **Evaluation Criteria**

You will be graded on:

* **Clarity of project idea** (Is it meaningful and specific?)
* **Quality of dataset** (Is it relevant, large enough, and useful?)
* **Effort in data collection** (Did you go beyond just downloading the first dataset you found?)
* **Documentation** (Did you clearly explain the dataset and its features?)
