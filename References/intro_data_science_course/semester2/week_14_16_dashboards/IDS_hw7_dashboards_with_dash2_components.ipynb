    "\n",
    "Dash apps consist of two parts: \n",

    "- *layout* - describes what the application looks like. \n",
    "- *callbacks* - supports the interactivity\n",

    "---\n",

    "Let's start by learning about the layout. In the code, it's a large block starting like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`app.layout = html.Div(children=[`\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see other components, such as a graph element:\n",

    "        figure=fig\n",

    "\n",
    "html tags such as this one to create a header:  \n",

    "Some important concepts:\n",
    "- the module `dash.html` supports the HTML tags\n",
    "- the module `dash.dcc` generates components like controls and graphs\n",
    "- The layout is composed of a tree of *components* such as `html.H1` and `dcc.Graph`\n",
    "- Each component is described by keyword attributes like `id` and `figure`\n",
