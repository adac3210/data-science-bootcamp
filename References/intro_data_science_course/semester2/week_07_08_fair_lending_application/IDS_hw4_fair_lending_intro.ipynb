It discusses how machine learning models are used for systematic decisioning of loans, and how models can be used to assess if the process is fair. You will complete the reading, and then work through an exercise that includes a synthetic dataset of lending information. You will fit (train) a logistic regression model to quantitatively assess fairness in the lending process.\n",
