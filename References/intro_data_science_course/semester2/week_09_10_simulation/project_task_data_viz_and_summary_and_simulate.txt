Introduction to Data Science 
Team Project Task: 
1) Data Visualization and Summarization
2) Simulation

Directions: 

In this project task, you will do three things: 

1) Visualize your data

a. Create two or more plots that are useful in better understanding the data
   Make sure they 
   - are the best plot for the job
   - are clear
   - include labels and title
   - exclude extraneous information

b. Explain your observations from the plots
   - if there are possible sources of bias, provide an explanation

2) Compute statistics to summarize your data

Depending on the data, it could make sense to compute counts or means, for example.

Show the summary statistics and explain:
1. What you decided to summarize
2. How you summarized it
3. What are the statistics telling you
4. Are there any sources of bias in your statistics?

3) Simulate based on your data

a. Select one variable from your dataset
b. Assume a distribution for this variable, such as the normal distribution. You can use the variable's mean and standard deviation as the parameters where necessary.
c. Draw samples from the distribution and create a histogram
d. Create a histogram of the actual data
e. Briefly discuss your findings from c-d

Submission Instructions:
At the top of your report, include the Team Project Task (see above), and the names of each team member.  
File format can be one of: word doc, pdf, text file or Jupyter notebook (ipynb).

Completing this assignment is worth 1 point.
