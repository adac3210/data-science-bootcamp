1) Think about the columns of your data and how you might transform them to be more useful.
Use what you learned about standardization, one hot encoding, binarization, and mathematical and statistical functions to
identify useful transformations.

Then transform some columns and explain:
1. Why you selected the columns and transformations
2. Show the first five rows of the original dataset 
3. Show the first five rows of the resulting dataset 

2) Thinking about your dataset, are there any ethical issues or privacy issues? Can you think of any sources of bias? Please briefly explain.
