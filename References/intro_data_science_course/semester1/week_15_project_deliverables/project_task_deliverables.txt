Introduction to Data Science 
Team Project Task: Deliverables

Directions: 

In this project task, you will have the following project deliverables:

1) Submit all code. This can be in one or more Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts (files ending in .py).  
   File names should include: team number, task name.
   Example - For the case of several notebooks, one might be called: team1_data_cleaning.ipynb
   Make sure the files are clear, organized, and commented.

2) Team presentation. 
   Each member of the team must present slides.
   There is no slide requirement, but be sure to cover all important information.   
   Slides should not make people read a lot. They should include a few lines of text and/or figures & images.
   If a slide is complex, split it into two simple slides.
   Be sure to practice beforehand to make sure delivery is clear and engaging.
   The slides should be in powerpoint or pdf. They should be visually appealing.
   The first slide should include: names of all team members, project title, date.
