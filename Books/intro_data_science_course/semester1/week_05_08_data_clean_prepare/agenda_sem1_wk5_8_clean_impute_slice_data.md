#### AGENDA

**WEEKS 5 - 6**

There is a lot of time in this unit, and there is also a lot of detailed content on the pandas module.

pandas is extremely useful for data wrangling.

You might begin by presenting the introductory pandas material in the notebook: pandas_dataframes,  
and then have them dive into the homework: IDS_hw2_pandas  
They can reference the pandas_dataframes notebook for help.

One area that is sometimes confusing for users is the difference between indexing with iloc() and loc()  
iloc() uses the row indexes, while loc() uses column names as strings

After students complete hw2, give them time to work on their team projects. They can apply their new pandas skills here.

**WEEKS 7 - 8**

You might begin by having students dive into the homework: IDS_hw3_pandas2  
They can reference the pandas_dataframes2 notebook for help.

After students complete hw3, give them time to work on their team projects.

Students can take quiz 1 after finishing everything above
