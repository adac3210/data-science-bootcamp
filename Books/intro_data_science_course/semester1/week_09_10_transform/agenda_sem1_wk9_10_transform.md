- Students submit journal after week 9
- Submit project task

#### AGENDA

- Review data transformations notebook

For the second meeting in the week, students can work on their team projects, applying what they learned.

There are more illustrations of data transformations in the notebook: additional_data_transform_examples.ipynb  
This is not required but might be helpful.
