#### AGENDA

**CLASS 1: LOADING DATA**
- Copy all course files to your machine (code and data)
- Make sure `datasets` folder is on machine
- Work with `input_output.ipynb` in JupyterLab to load existing csv files
- Write code in Spyder to load existing csv files
- Discuss how Python uses whitespace. The standard convention is to use 4 spaces per indentation level like this:

```
def some_function(input1):  
    first_var = 4  
        another_variable = 'eight spaces'  
    return first_var  # the return command lines up with first indent level  
```

**CLASS 2: TEAM PROJECT**
- Students work in teams of 2-3 on their team project. They can begin by identifying a dataset of interest.
