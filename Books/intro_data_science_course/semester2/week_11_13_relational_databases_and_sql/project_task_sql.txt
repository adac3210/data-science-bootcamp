Introduction to Data Science 
Team Project Task: Working with a Database and SQL

Directions: 

It is often beneficial to store structured data from a large project into a relational database.

In this assignment, you will select part or all of your project dataset and migrate it to a SQLite database. You can use the lecture notes and Google to help.

Hint: You DON'T want to manually create the records to populate the database.  
You might first read the data into Python using pandas and use code for the task.

After the data is migrated, you will do these things, showing all code and results:

1. Write SQL to count how many records are in one of the tables. Show the table name.  
2. Write SQL to select the first 5 records in this table.  
3. Write SQL to filter the table on a condition and show the first 5 records.  

Submission Instructions:
At the top of your report, include the Team Project Task (see above), and the names of each team member.  
File format can be one of: word doc, pdf, text file or Jupyter notebook (ipynb).

Completing this assignment is worth 1 point.
