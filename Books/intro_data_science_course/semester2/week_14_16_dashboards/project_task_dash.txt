Team Project Task: Working with Dash to Build a Dashboard

Directions: 

For communicating with data and telling a story, dashboards are powerful. Interactive dashboards provide choice in how the user can see the data.

In this assignment, you will populate a Dash app with your project data to build a dashboard. You can use the lecture notes, the Dash documentation, and Google to help.

You can make you Dash app as fancy as you like! Just be sure to make it useful and easy to interpret.

One cool feature we didn't cover: it is possible to create a dashboard with multiple tabs, for different pages of interactive content.

Submission Instructions:
At the top of your report, include the Team Project Task (see above), and the names of each team member.  

The report should include:

- the code behind the app
- one or more screenshots of the dashboard
- a short description of what the controls do (e.g., the dropdown allows the user to select different variables for the axes)

File format can be one of: word doc, pdf, or text file

Completing this assignment is worth 1 point.
