### SEMESTER 2
### WEEKS 14-16
### TOPIC: 
- Dashboards

---  

#### LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Build an interactive dashboard using Dash

#### DELIVERABLES
- IDS_hw7_dashboards_with_dash2_components
- Submit journal after week 15
- Submit project task

#### AGENDA

**CLASS 1:**  
Students visit the Dash website to see fun examples of dashboards.  
Next, they copy sample code from Dash into a file, run the script at the command line, and view the dashboard on a browser.
This dashboard is actually running on their own machine (localhost), but appears to be on the web.

Review this notebook with students:  
dashboards_with_dash_getting_started

Note: There is a link for students to find the code - app.py    
In case the code is unavailable or the link breaks, the file is saved in the repo as a backup.

Ask students to briefly review this site before next class:  
https://dash.plotly.com/layout

**CLASS 2:**    

Students build a greater understanding of Dash components, allowing them to modify the app.  
This includes learning:  
- the layout, which describes what the application looks like
- controls, such as dropdown lists and sliders, which capture input from the user
- callbacks, which are triggered when control attributes change, allowing for user interactivity.  
Example, the user moves the slider, changing the min date range from 1995 to 2005. The graph updates, filtering out the data points before 2005.

The notebook in this lesson will prompt students to make small modifications to their code, run it, and check that the dashboard is producing the desired results. Example: add a dropdown, populate it with data, sort the data, ...  
It will be collected as homework.  This exercise will likely take students two full meetings (approx 80 mins total).

There are several app files which show the incremental steps, mirroring the homework.  
Do not share the app files with students; these are for the instructor.

**CLASS 4:**  

Students will work on their project task: using their data to build a Dash app

---

**CLASS 5:** 

Students will work on their project task: using their data to build a Dash app

**CLASS 6:**

This time can be used by students to continue working on their project, or they can build a different Dash app.
