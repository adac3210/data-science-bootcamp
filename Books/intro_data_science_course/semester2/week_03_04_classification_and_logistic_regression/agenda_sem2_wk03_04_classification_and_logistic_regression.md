### SEMESTER 2
### WEEKS 3-4
### TOPIC: 
- sigmoid function
- thresholding
- logistic regression

---  

#### LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Understand why a sigmoid function can be used to model a binary classification problem
- Use functions that apply vectorization
- Apply thresholding to probabilities to return predicted labels
- Understand how the sigmoid function changes when the parameters change
- Implement logistic regression using `sklearn`
- Use the sigmoid function to compute the predicted probability
- Compute binary classification metrics

#### DELIVERABLES
- Students complete IDS_hw2
- Students submit journal after week 3
- Submit project task

#### AGENDA

**CLASS 1:**  
Review notebook: classification_and_sigmoid_function

The instructor may wish to motivate binary classification by first reviewing **Exercise 4: Basketball Free Throws**.  
Students can see the data and start thinking about the problem.  
Then the lesson can be reviewed, and students can return to the problem with ideas.

**CLASS 2:**  
Review notebook: logistic_regression_w_breast_cancer_data

**CLASS 3:**  
Review notebook: logistic_regression_w_breast_cancer_data

**CLASS 4:**  
- Begin HW on logistic regression. Students will likely need help with binary classification metrics.
- Students work their team project
