    "### What are Hyperparameters?\n",

    "* **Number of Trees** (in a forest model): More trees might give better predictions, but also take longer.\n",
    "* **Maximum Depth** (in decision trees): Controls how complex the tree is.\n",
    "* **Regularization Strength**: Helps prevent the model from overfitting (memorizing instead of learning).\n",

    "Since we don’t know the best hyperparameter settings at the start, we try many different combinations to find the best one. This process is called **hyperparameter tuning**.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Learning rate: 0.01, 0.1\n",
    "  * Max depth: 3, 5\n",

    "  * (0.01, 3), (0.01, 5), (0.1, 3), (0.1, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  **RandomizedSearchCV**\n",

    "* It **randomly picks combinations** of values to try.\n",
    "* Faster than GridSearchCV when there are a lot of combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Goal of Hyperparameter Tuning\n",

    "\n",
    "* Adjusting the **oven temperature** and **baking time** to get the perfect cake.\n",
    "* Testing different **study strategies** to get the best exam score.\n",
    "* Trying different **gear setups** in a video game to win more matches.\n",
